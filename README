gEDA library

This is my personal library of schematic symbols and PCB footprints for use 
with the gEDA tools (see http://www.gpleda.org).

These are referenced by my schematics and PCB layouts, which expect this to
be present in a directory alongside the project directory.

These files are released under the terms of the GNU General Public License
